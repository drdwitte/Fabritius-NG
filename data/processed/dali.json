        "summary": "The painting depicts a surreal dreamscape characterized by an otherworldly atmosphere and bizarre juxtapositions. In the foreground, a skeletal figure, possibly representing humanity or suffering, is seated, holding a cross in a gesture of devotion or despair. Above, a white horse stands on elongated legs, signifying a surreal, ethereal quality, while other similarly styled horse figures seem to float, defying the laws of gravity. The background features an architectural structure that merges classical elements with fantastical designs, topped with pointed spires and adorned with human figures engaged in enigmatic activities. The overall emotional tone oscillates between tension and tranquility, evoking a range of interpretations from existential angst to spiritual contemplation. Dominating the color palette are muted earth tones punctuated by ethereal greens and blues, allowing enhancements of the surrealism. The composition employs diagonal lines that lead the viewer’s eye through the piece, creating a dynamic visual flow. The historical context suggests an exploration of existential and religious themes, reflective of surrealist traditions that challenge reality and provoke deep contemplation. Key themes include the tension between the sacred and the profane, the struggle of humanity, and the illusion of physical and psychological barriers.",
